# AP.MobileToolkit.Resources

The resources package is intended to provide a set of common words or phrases that you may use throughout your app like `Ok` or `Next`, etc.

Currently these resources are also available in Spanish but we plan on adding additional languages and would gladly take a PR from any native speakers to add or update localizations. Please be sure to use the [Multilingual App Toolkit Editor](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/multilingual-app-toolkit/) to edit the xlf files when translating.
