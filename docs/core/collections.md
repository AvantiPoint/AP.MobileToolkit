## Grouping

Want an easy to use Grouping&lt;TKey, TItem&gt; or need a Grouping&lt;TKey, TSubKey, TItem&gt;. Both are included.

## Observable Collections

- ObservableDictionary: Just like a normal dictionary but observable
- ObservableErrorCollection: A custom ObservableRangeCollection of ValidationError's
- ObservableRangeCollection: Similar to the ObservableCollection except this allows you to add or remove a range of items with a single notification from INotifyCollectionChanged
- ObservableStack: For those times where you need the functionality of a Stack the ObservableStack lets you do what you need to do while maintaining observability.
